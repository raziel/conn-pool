== Description ==
Flexible implementation of a Database Connection Pool. It allows to work with different kinds of Data Sources, as well as swapping different strategies for managing (creating, reallocating, removing) the connections.

==How to Build the Project==
The Connection Pool is a standard maven project (http://maven.apache.org). Thus, assuming you have installed maven and consequently Java, in order to build the JAR just execute the following goal at the level of the pom.xml file:

/conn-pool $ mvn clean install

This will run the tests and place the JAR file in the target directory.
